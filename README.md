# Software-Engineering-for-AI-Systems-DIT821
The course is a part of the Software Engineering and Management program at Gothenburg University and Chalmers University of Technology.

The purpose of the course ins to give to students insights in basics of AI,  its use, basics of software engineering of AI-based systems.

The course addresses issues relevant for software engineering for systems that use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning or large-scale parallel data processing. The course gives a) an introduction of basic principles of AI, with emphasis on the principles and techniques used in machine learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, enforcement learning , and b) insights to support needed for successful implementation of AI systems.

The course addresses the life cycle of AI systems: It includes data preparation (i.e. collecting data, data processing, storage, analysis), and building AI models by training and validation. It also discusses use of data, such as implications of using different data sets for the same goal, or using the same data set for different goals.   Finally, the ethical considerations in using data and providing automatically-created solutions are discussed.
